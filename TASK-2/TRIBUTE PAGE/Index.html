    <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong> is referred to as the ‘King’. The Indian captain’s batting record is hardly matched by any other cricketer on the planet, with his aggressive approach to the game also making him a player fans flock to watch. <br> <br> Kohli always dreamed of representing his country in cricket and had his first opportunity as a teenager when he played for the India under-19 team in 2006, guiding the same team to a World Cup win in 2008. <br> <br>Virat Kohli’s brilliance with the bat is matched by his skills as a captain in all three forms of the game. While a major tournament win still eludes the Indian’s under his leadership, the side has regularly held the #1 world ranking in both Test and ODI cricket. He has the greatest Test Match winning percentage as an Indian captain, with a most recent triumph being a 2-1 series victory against Australia – the first ever Indian series win on Australian soil.  </p>

        <img src="./Img/vk2.png" alt="" srcset="">
        <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong> is indeed India's greatest Test captain. With 39 victories from 66 attempts, Kohli holds the record for the most wins as Indian Test skipper, surpassing his predecessor MS Dhoni, who captained the side to 27 victories. <br> <br> Kohli also took India from 7th in the ICC Test rankings in 2014, all the way to the top of the rankings by the time he stepped down from the role in January 2022. <br> <br> The 34-year-old also scored the most runs in Test cricket as captain of any Indian player in history with 5,864. The only players across the world stage who sit ahead of Kohli in this statistic are Graeme Smith, Allan Border and Ricky Ponting.
